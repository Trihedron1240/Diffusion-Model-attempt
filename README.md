# Diffusion-Model-attempt
This is my first attempt at building a diffusion model from scratch in PyTorch — trained on CelebA to generate 64×64 faces.
An unconditional DDPM (denoising diffusion probabilistic model) with a UNet backbone, trained with ε-prediction and sampled using ancestral DDPM steps.

 Note: I am unable to train this model fully yet due to the limitations in computing resources i currently have available
